ðŸ›’ E-Commerce Mobile App (React Native & TypeScript)

This project is a fully functional e-commerce mobile application developed to improve my TypeScript skills. It includes essential e-commerce features such as product listing, product detail pages, adding to favorites, category filtering, and cart operations.
